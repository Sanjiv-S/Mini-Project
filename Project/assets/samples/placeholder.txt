This is a placeholder file to ensure the samples directory exists. 

In a real application, you would place sample eye scan images in this directory with filenames:
- normal.jpg
- diabetic-retinopathy.jpg
- glaucoma.jpg
- cataract.jpg

Since we can't include binary files, you can use URLs of eye scan images from medical repositories or provide your own images.
